# Hydration-Monitoring-System
This project develops an Arduino Uno-based hydration monitor using three homemade sensors that measure hydration via electrical conductivity. Real-time data is shown on an LCD, with buzzer alerts when levels drop too low, offering a low-cost, effective tool to help prevent dehydration.
## Project Overview 
This project presents a hydration monitoring system built on an Arduino Uno and three sensors made from scratch, designed to measure hydration levels through electrical conductivity. 
The system continuously tracks readings and calculates hydration percentage, displaying the results in real time on an LCD display. 
A buzzer alert is triggered when hydration levels fall below a set threshold, ensuring timely notifications for the user. 
The goal of the project is to provide a low-cost, practical, and accessible solution for monitoring hydration, thereby helping to prevent dehydration-related complications and supporting everyday health management.
